# SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Data Processing and Transformer-Based Modeling Pipeline

## Introduction

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to processing SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and implementing a Transformer-based model for phylogenetic analysis. We will cover data collection, feature engineering, the conceptual framework behind the model, and a Python implementation using TensorFlow.

## Prerequisites

### Tools:
*   Conda
*   UShER
*   NCBI-datasets-cli

*   TensorFlow
*   Nextflow (optional, for pipeline management)

### Conceptual Knowledge:
*   Basic understanding of genomic data (FASTA, VCF formats)
*   Familiarity with phylogenetic concepts (ancestral sequence reconstruction, phylogenetic trees)
*   Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts (Transformers, sequence-to-sequence models)

## Expected Outcomes

By completing this tutorial, you will:
*   Understand the workflow for collecting and processing SARS-CoV-2 genomic data.
*   Learn how to perform feature engineering for input into a machine learning model.
*   Gain insights into the conceptual framework of using Transformer models for phylogenetic analysis.
*   Have a trained Transformer model capable of predicting ancestral sequences or other phylogenetic tasks.
*   Be able to adapt this pipeline for your own research questions.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 1. Database Construction with UShER

The initial step involves constructing a comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 database using UShER. This database will serve as the foundation for our analysis.

```bash
# Example command for updating the UShER database
usher -d /path/to/local/db --update
```
*Note: Ensure UShER is properly installed and configured. The path to the local database should be specified.*

### 2. Downloading Reference Genomes

We need a reference genome for alignment and variant calling. The following commands download the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) and its annotation.

```bash
# Download reference genome and annotation
datasets download genome accession NC_045512.2 --include gff3,genome --filename SC2.zip
unzip SC2.zip
mv ncbi_dataset/data/NC_045512.2/NC_045512.2.fna ./SC2_ref.fasta
mv ncbi_dataset/data/NC_045512.2/genomic.gff ./SC2_ref.gff
```

### 3. Processing and Filtering VCF Data

UShER outputs data in a VCF format. We need to process and filter this data. The provided Python script `vcf_processer.py` handles the conversion of VCF files to a more usable format, such as a Pandas DataFrame, and performs necessary filtering.

*Placeholder for `vcf_processer.py` script content. This script should be created and its functionality detailed here.*
```python
# vcf_processer.py (Conceptual)
import pysam
import pandas as pd

def process_vcf(vcf_path):
    # Load VCF file
    vcf_file = pysam.VariantFile(vcf_path)

    # Extract relevant information (e.g., position, reference allele, alternative allele)
    data = []
    for record in vcf_file.fetch():
        data.append({
            'position': record.pos,
            'ref_allele': record.ref,
            'alt_allele': record.alts[0] if record.alts else None,
            # Add other relevant fields
        })

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    # Perform filtering and preprocessing as needed
    return df

# Example usage:
# processed_data = process_vcf("path/to/your/vcf_file.vcf")
# print(processed_data.head())
```
[Details on `vcf_processer.py` functionality and specific filtering steps to be added here.]

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for preparing the data for the Transformer model. This involves representing genomic sequences and phylogenetic information in a format suitable for machine learning.

### 1. Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction

Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is a key component. UShER can be used for this purpose.
[Details on existing documentation on ancestral sequence reconstruction to be added here for context, including how UShER performs this.]

The output of ASR, typically in FASTA format, will be used as input for the model.

### 2. Phylogenetic Tree Integration

The phylogenetic tree provides valuable information about the relationships between sequences. We can use DendroPy to parse and manipulate phylogenetic trees.

```python
# Conceptual Python snippet for tree processing
import dendropy

# Load a tree
tree = dendropy.Tree.get(path="path/to/tree.newick", schema="newick")

# Iterate through nodes and extract features
for node in tree:
    # Example: Get node annotations or path information
    if node.annotations.get_value("mutation"):
        print(f"Node {node.taxon.label if node.taxon else 'Internal'} has mutation: {node.annotations.get_value('mutation')}")
```
[More specific details on how tree features are extracted and integrated into the model input should be provided.]

## Conceptual Framework: Transformer for Phylogenetic Analysis

We employ a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model. The core idea is to treat ancestral sequence reconstruction or related phylogenetic tasks as a translation problem.

*   **Input:** A representation of the descendant sequence (or a summary of descendant sequences) and potentially other phylogenetic features.
*   **Output:** The predicted ancestral sequence or other target phylogenetic information.

The Transformer's attention mechanism is well-suited for capturing long-range dependencies in genomic sequences and complex relationships within phylogenetic trees.

[A diagram illustrating the model architecture would be beneficial here.]

## Transformer Implementation (Python with TensorFlow)

This section outlines the Python implementation of the Transformer model using TensorFlow.

### 1. Data Preparation and Tokenization

Genomic sequences (A, C, G, T, N, -) need to be tokenized into numerical representations.

```python
# Conceptual tokenization
vocab = {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'G': 3, 'T': 4, 'N': 5, '-': 0} # '-' for padding/gap
seq = "ACGTN-"
tokenized_seq = [vocab[char] for char in seq]
```

### 2. Model Architecture

The Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder.

```python
# Conceptual TensorFlow Transformer model
import tensorflow as tf

# Define Encoder, Decoder, and Transformer classes (simplified)
# (Based on TensorFlow tutorials or custom implementation)

# Example:
# num_layers = 4
# d_model = 128
# num_heads = 8
# dff = 512
# input_vocab_size = len(vocab) + 1 # for masking
# target_vocab_size = len(vocab) + 1 # for masking

# transformer = Transformer(
#     num_layers=num_layers,
#     d_model=d_model,
#     num_heads=num_heads,
#     dff=dff,
#     input_vocab_size=input_vocab_size,
#     target_vocab_size=target_vocab_size,
#     pe_input=10000, # Positional encoding max length
#     pe_target=10000
# )
```
[Detailed code for the Transformer architecture, including Encoder, Decoder, Attention layers, and Positional Encoding, should be provided or referenced.]

### 3. Training the Model

The model is trained using pairs of input (e.g., descendant sequence) and target (e.g., ancestral sequence) data.

```python
# Conceptual training loop
# optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
# loss_object = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True, reduction='none')

# def loss_function(real, pred):
#     mask = tf.math.logical_not(tf.math.equal(real, 0)) # Assuming 0 is padding
#     loss_ = loss_object(real, pred)
#     mask = tf.cast(mask, dtype=loss_.dtype)
#     loss_ *= mask
#     return tf.reduce_sum(loss_)/tf.reduce_sum(mask)

# @tf.function
# def train_step(inp, tar):
#     tar_inp = tar[:, :-1]
#     tar_real = tar[:, 1:]
#     # ... (training step logic) ...

# EPOCHS = 20
# for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
#     # ... (iterate over dataset and call train_step) ...
#     print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1} Loss {train_loss.result():.4f} Accuracy {train_accuracy.result():.4f}')
```
[The complete training script, including data loading, batching, and evaluation, should be detailed.]

### 4. Inference and Prediction

Once trained, the model can be used to predict ancestral sequences.

```python
# Conceptual inference function
# def predict(input_sequence_str):
#    # Tokenize input
#    # Pass through the trained model
#    # Detokenize output
#    return predicted_sequence_str

# example_input = "ACGTT..."
# predicted_ancestor = predict(example_input)
# print(f"Predicted Ancestor: {predicted_ancestor}")
```

## Pipeline Orchestration (Optional: Nextflow)

For managing complex workflows, Nextflow can be used.

```nextflow
// Conceptual Nextflow pipeline script
// main.nf

// Define processes for each step:
// 1. fetchData (UShER update, reference download)
// 2. processVCFs
// 3. ancestralReconstruction
// 4. trainTransformerModel
// 5. predictAncestors

// Example process:
// process processVCFs {
//     input:
//     path vcf_file
//
//     output:
//     path "*.csv"
//
//     script:
//     """
//     python vcf_processer.py --input ${vcf_file} --output processed_data.csv
//     """
// }

// Define workflow
// workflow {
//    // ... chain processes ...
// }
```
[A more complete Nextflow script example tailored to this specific pipeline would be beneficial.]
