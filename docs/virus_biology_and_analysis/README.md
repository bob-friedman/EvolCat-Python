# Virus Biology and Analysis

This section of the EvolCat-Python documentation focuses on topics related to virus biology, evolution, genomics, and their bioinformatic analysis.

## Contents
*   [**Virus Genomics, Diversity, and Analysis Guide**](./virus_genomics_guide.md): A comprehensive guide to understanding viral genomes, measuring diversity, performing phylogenetic analysis, and core bioinformatic tasks.
*   [**Condensed Report on Virus Evolution and Biotechnological Innovation**](./condensed_virus_evolution_report.md): A summary of key advancements in the study of virus evolution, with a focus on the role of recombination and biotechnological innovations.
*   [**Guide to Key Biotechnologies in Virology Research**](./biotechnologies_in_virology_guide.md): An overview of foundational and cutting-edge biotechnologies used in virology.
*   [**Guide to Estimating Mutational Fitness Effects from Large-Scale Viral Sequence Data**](./estimating_mutation_fitness_effects_guide.md): Outlines a methodology for estimating mutation fitness effects based on observed vs. expected mutation counts from sequence data.
*   [**UShER Toolkit and matUtils: A Condensed Guide**](./usher_toolkit_report.md): A guide to using the UShER toolkit and `matUtils` for phylogenetic placement and analysis of large viral datasets, particularly SARS-CoV-2.
