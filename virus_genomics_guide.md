# Guide to Virus Genomics, Diversity, and Analysis

## Introduction to Virus Genomics
(Placeholder for content: Briefly explain what virus genomics is, its importance, and key characteristics of viral genomes, e.g., size, mutation rates, RNA vs DNA.)

## Measuring Viral Diversity
(Placeholder for content: Discuss common metrics and methods used to quantify viral diversity, e.g., nucleotide diversity, haplotype analysis, quasispecies.)

## Phylogenetic Analysis of Viruses
(Placeholder for content: Explain how phylogenetic methods are applied to viruses, what insights can be gained, e.g., tracking outbreaks, understanding evolutionary relationships. Mention specific EvolCat-Python scripts or external tools if applicable.)

## Tools and Resources
(Placeholder for content: List relevant EvolCat-Python scripts that can be used for viral genomics. Also, list key external databases, software, and web resources for viral genomics research.)

## Example Workflow: Analyzing a Viral Dataset
(Placeholder for content: Outline a hypothetical step-by-step workflow for analyzing a small viral dataset, from sequence retrieval to diversity calculation and phylogenetic tree construction, mentioning which tools (EvolCat-Python or external) would be used at each step.)
