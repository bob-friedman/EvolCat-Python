# Virus Biology and Analysis Scripts

This directory contains Python scripts for processing viral mutation data. Many are referenced in the guides. The exception is in the extras/ directory.

retrieve_attention_scores.py: A helper script in Python to retrieve attention scores from a seq2seq Transformer model. It illustrates a procedure to create an input file for the model, but it only depends on the final pairs of sequence data as generated by the related pipelines here. These scores are exported in CSV format and used for correlation analyses.
	
sasa_analysis.py: A script in Python that shows a procedure to analyze IEDB data (in this case, B cell epitopes) and perform statistical analyses, such as any association between the attention scores from `retrieve_attention_scores.py` and whether residues of the corresponding protein are identified as present on the surface or buried.
	
tree_visualization.py: A script in Python that accepts a bootstrap consensus tree as generated by IQ-TREE and generates an ASCII-based visualization with boostrap values. FigTree (Java-based) is an alternative program for visualization and generates a publication quality image.
