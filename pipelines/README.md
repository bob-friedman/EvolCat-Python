## Scripts for Virus Biology and Analysis

> Welcome to the Pipelines page in the EvolCat-Python project. This section provides a collection of scripts and guides covering everything from core virology concepts to advanced bioinformatic pipelines. The files in this directory are structured as guides so their purpose is described in the Guides section. The descriptions below are specific to the scripts in extras/ which are sample code to extend a Python-based pipeline.

## ðŸ“– Scripts in Extras/

*   [**retrieve_attention_scores.py**](./extras/retrieve_attention_scores.py):
    *   *This Python script retrieves attention scores from a pre-trained seq2seq Transformer model. It takes pairs of sequence data (ancestor-descendant) as input. The script outputs a CSV file containing these attention scores, which can then be utilized for further analyses, such as correlating them with other biological data. For a more detailed explanation of attention scores and their utility, please see the [Attention Scores Document](attention_scores.md).*
	
*   [**sasa_analysis.py**](./extras/sasa_analysis.py):
    *   *This Python script is designed to analyze data from the IEDB (Immune Epitope Database), with a specific focus on B cell epitopes. It performs statistical analyses, including correlating attention scores obtained from `retrieve_attention_scores.py` with [Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)](SASA.md). This helps determine if residues located on the protein surface tend to receive more attention from the model.*
	
*   [**tree_visualization.py**](./extras/tree_visualization.py):
    *   *This Python script accepts a bootstrap consensus tree file (commonly generated by tools like IQ-TREE) as input. It generates an ASCII-based visualization of the phylogenetic tree, clearly displaying bootstrap support values on the internal nodes. While tools like FigTree (Java-based) are available for creating publication-quality images, this script provides a quick and convenient method for text-based tree visualization.*
