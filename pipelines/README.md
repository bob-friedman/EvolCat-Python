# Virus Biology and Analysis Scripts

This directory contains Python scripts for processing viral mutation data. Many are referenced in the guides. The exception is in the extras/ directory.

[retrieve_attention_scores.py](./extras/retrieve_attention_scores.py): This Python script retrieves attention scores from a pre-trained seq2seq Transformer model. It takes pairs of sequence data (ancestor-descendant) as input. The script outputs a CSV file containing these attention scores, which can then be utilized for further analyses, such as correlating them with other biological data.
	
[sasa_analysis.py](./extras/sasa_analysis.py): This Python script is designed to analyze data from the IEDB (Immune Epitope Database), with a specific focus on B cell epitopes. It performs statistical analyses, including correlating attention scores obtained from `retrieve_attention_scores.py` with Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA). This helps determine if residues located on the protein surface tend to receive more attention from the model.
	
[tree_visualization.py](./extras/tree_visualization.py): This Python script accepts a bootstrap consensus tree file (commonly generated by tools like IQ-TREE) as input. It generates an ASCII-based visualization of the phylogenetic tree, clearly displaying bootstrap support values on the internal nodes. While tools like FigTree (Java-based) are available for creating publication-quality images, this script provides a quick and convenient method for text-based tree visualization.
