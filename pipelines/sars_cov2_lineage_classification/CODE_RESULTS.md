# SARS-CoV-2 Lineage Classification Pipeline

## Overview
This document describes an end-to-end pipeline for processing SARS-CoV-2 mutation data, classifying fine-grained lineages using a neural network, and interpreting the model's decisions through saliency analysis. The goal is to identify key mutations that define these lineages, potentially corresponding to known biological markers.

The pipeline involves several stages:
1.  **Setup and Data Acquisition**: Preparing the environment and downloading necessary data, including the UShER Mutation-Annotated Tree (MAT).
2.  **Clade-Specific Data Extraction**: Isolating data for specific clades of interest into VCF format.
3.  **Sequence and Variant Processing**: Generating consensus sequences and programmatically accessing VCF data.
4.  **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw variant data into a numerical matrix suitable for machine learning, with significant attention to memory optimization and data integrity.
5.  **Modeling**: Building, training, and evaluating a neural network classifier.
6.  **Interpretation**: Using saliency mapping to understand which mutations are most influential in the model's classification decisions.

This pipeline is designed to be run in an environment like Google Colab, leveraging its capabilities for package installation and distributed computing, though it can be adapted for other environments.

## Python Script: `sars_cov2_lineage_classifier.py`

```python
# Processing SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Data

# 1. Mount Google MyDrive in Google Colab
from google.colab import drive
import os

# Mount Google MyDrive for use in Google Colab
# For Google Colab: had to activate all allowable permissions for access to MyDrive to avoid authentication error
drive.mount('/content/drive')
os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive')

# 2. Installation of Conda for Google Colab

# Installation of Conda for Google Colab
!pip install -q condacolab > /dev/null # suppress standard output
# Install Conda
import condacolab; condacolab.install()
# Initialize the shell and restart the kernel
# Google Colab usually restarts by itself and reports a warning message
#  however, the installation procedure is expected to continue
!conda init bash
# Verify installation
!conda --version

# 3. Installation of the UShER toolkit via Conda

# Installation of the UShER toolkit for Conda
# Otherwise, see documentation for other options:
#  https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html
# Create a new environment for UShER
!conda create -n usher-env # python=3.10 # to support BTE library, if installed
# Activate the newly created environment
!conda activate usher-env

# Set up channels
!conda config --add channels defaults
!conda config --add channels bioconda
!conda config --add channels conda-forge
# Install the UShER package
!conda install -q usher

# 4. Download the UShER Mutation-Annotated Tree (MAT) data

# Download the latest UShER Mutation-Annotated Tree (MAT) data (.pb extension name)
file_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/public-latest.all.masked.pb"
if os.path.isfile(file_path):
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' exists.")
else:
    print(f"The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")
    !wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/public-latest.all.masked.pb.gz

# Uncompress the MAT data file (-f parameter will force a file overwrite)
# Creates public-latest.all.masked.pb
!gunzip -f public-latest.all.masked.pb.gz

# Optional: Export a Newick tree
# !matUtils extract --input-mat public-latest.all.masked.pb --write-tree usher_tree.nwk

# Export summary data associated with the MAT file (e.g., --clades, --node-stats, --mutations, --samples, --get-all)
# !matUtils summary --input-mat public-latest.all.masked.pb --clades clades.tsv
# !matUtils summary --input-mat public-latest.all.masked.pb --samples samples.txt

# 5. Obtain mutation data for subtree

# Obtain mutation data for each node in the subtree

# Verify public-latest.all.masked.pb is in the current working directory
# Replace "YOUR_CLADE_OF_INTEREST" with the actual clade name, e.g., "20H (Beta)"
# May replace "mutations_for_clade.txt" with another output filename

# Tested with clade \`20H (Beta)\` clade of SARS-CoV-2 with 10179 samples:
# If scaling to larger file size, note the full SARS-CoV-2 dataset is
# ~800x as many samples as clade \`20H (Beta)\`

# Command below to extract mutations for clade "20H (Beta)"
# leads to file output size of ~500 Mb
# !matUtils extract --input-mat public-latest.all.masked.pb --clade "20H (Beta)" --all-paths mutations_for_clade.txt

# Clade         Samples
# 20H (Beta)    10179
# 20J (Gamma)   32210
# 23E (XBB.2.3) 16362

# !cat public-latest.metadata.tsv | grep -nr "21H" | wc -l
# 6362
# !cat public-latest.metadata.tsv | grep -nr "20J" | wc -l
# 32317
# !cat public-latest.metadata.tsv | grep -nr "23E" | wc -l
# 21550
# !cat public-latest.metadata.tsv | grep -nr "XBB.2.3" | wc -l
# 16393

# !matUtils extract -i public-latest.all.masked.pb -c "20H (Beta)" -v my_clade.vcf
# !matUtils extract -i public-latest.all.masked.pb -c "20J (Gamma)" -v my_clade.vcf
# Try single quotes to access clade names with the '.' characters
# Try of double quotes for the clade name fails to properly identify the clade
!matUtils extract -i public-latest.all.masked.pb -c 'XBB.2.3' -v my_clade.vcf

#!matUtils extract \
#    --input-mat public-latest.all.masked.pb \
#    --clade "YOUR_CLADE_OF_INTEREST" \
#    --all-paths mutations_for_clade.txt

# Explanation of the command:
# \`--input-mat public-latest.all.masked.pb\`: Specifies the input MAT file.
# \`--clade "YOUR_CLADE_OF_INTEREST"\`: Focuses the extraction on the members of the named clade. This name must exactly
#  match a clade name present in the MAT file's metadata. May specify multiple clade names as a comma-delimited list.
#  Add double quotes to the names with spaces.
# \`--all-paths mutations_for_clade.txt\`: This crucial option tells \`matUtils\` to output the mutations along each path
#  from the clade's common ancestor to every sample and internal node within that clade. The output is saved to
#\` mutations_for_clade.txt\`. The list is created by a depth-first traversal order.

# Output Format:
# The output file (\`mutations_for_clade.txt\`) will typically list each node (internal nodes often labeled like
#  \`node_X:\`) or sample (e.g., \`Country/SampleID/Date|Accession|Date:\`) followed by the mutations inferred to have
#  occurred on the branch immediately leading to it. For example:
#  node_1: G15910T
#  Sample/ID/Date|Accession|Date: C1191T,C11674T
#  node_2: T13090C

# This detailed mutation information is invaluable for understanding the specific evolutionary changes within a
# lineage and can serve as input for further analyses, including preparing data for training predictive models like
# Transformers.

#   Rows: One for each sample.
#   Columns: One for each unique genetic mutation found in the dataset.
#   Values: \`1\` if a sample has a mutation, and \`0\` if it does not.

## Advanced `matUtils` Usage and Data Extraction Strategies

Beyond the single-clade extraction used in the primary pipeline workflow, `matUtils` offers capabilities for more comprehensive data access. For users interested in:

*   A detailed breakdown of how `matUtils extract` is used for targeted clade data retrieval.
*   A conceptual strategy for systematically extracting data for *all* clades from the MAT `.pb` file using a divide-and-conquer approach.

Please refer to the supplementary document: **[./matutils_implementation.md](./matutils_implementation.md)**.

This guide discusses methods for obtaining a full list of clades and iteratively extracting their respective variant data, which is essential for large-scale analyses of the entire SARS-CoV-2 dataset.

## Utility and Critique of the Pipeline
### 1. Analysis of Methodology

This Python pipeline is robust, logical, and follows best practices.

*   **Part 1-4: Setup & Data Acquisition:** Standard and correct. It uses `conda` for environment management and `wget` to pull the latest, most comprehensive Mutation-Annotated Tree (MAT) from UShER. This is the right foundation.
*   **Part 5: Clade-Specific Data Extraction:** This is a critical step for making the problem manageable. Using `matUtils extract` with the `--clade` and `-v` (VCF output) flags is the perfect way to isolate the data for your clades of interest (e.g., `20H`, `20J`, `23E`). VCF is an excellent, standardized format for this.
*   **Part 6-7: Sequence & Variant Processing:** The use of `bcftools` to create a consensus sequence and `pysam` to programmatically access the VCF data is spot-on. Using `vcf.fetch()` on an indexed VCF (`my_clade.vcf.gz`) is highly efficient and the professionally recommended way to handle these files.
*   **Part 8: Feature Engineering:** This is arguably the most important part of the pipeline, and it's executed beautifully.
    *   **Memory Optimization:** Filtering the massive `metadata.tsv` *before* processing by keeping only the strains present in your VCF is a crucial optimization that prevents memory crashes. Using `gc.collect()` is also good practice.
    *   **Feature Matrix `X`:** Correctly identified that each unique mutation is a feature. Building the `variant_to_samples_map` and then creating the `(samples x mutations)` matrix is the right approach. Using `dtype='int8'` is a very smart memory-saving technique.
    *   **Singleton Removal:** **This is a critical and sophisticated step.** Removing lineages with only one sample is essential for using stratified splitting (`train_test_split`) and for building a generalizable model. A model can't learn to classify a group from a single example.
*   **Part 9-11: Modeling, Evaluation & Saliency:**
    *   **Data Splitting:** Using `train_test_split` with `stratify=y_np` is absolutely essential for this kind of imbalanced dataset. It ensures that the distribution of lineages is the same in your training and test sets, leading to a much more reliable evaluation.
    *   **Model Architecture:** A simple, dense neural network is a great starting point for this type of tabular data. The architecture (128 -> 64 -> num_classes) with ReLU and Softmax activations is a classic and effective choice.
    *   **Saliency Analysis:** This is the most advanced part. It correctly uses `tf.GradientTape` to calculate the gradient of the correct class output with respect to the input features. This directly answers the question: *"To correctly identify this sample, which mutations did the model 'pay attention' to the most?"* Generating a clean `.csv` report is far more useful for analysis than just plots.

### 2. Interpretation of Saliency Reports

The saliency reports are the payoff. They let us peer inside the "black box" of the neural network.

A key concept here is the **"importance" score**. A high score for a mutation means that changing this feature would have a large impact on the model's output for a specific lineage. In essence, it's a mutation the model has learned is a **strong and reliable identifier** for that lineage.

#### Example Analysis of `saliency_report_top10_23e.csv` (Clade XBB.2.3)

This report (from the sample run data) would show varying levels of importance for mutations across different sublineages of XBB.2.3.

*   **Highly Distinct Lineages:** For example, `XBB.2.3.13` (importance up to **0.8**), `HH.1` (**0.54**), and `XCQ` (**0.38**) are highlighted as extremely clear to the model in the provided analysis. Mutations like `5730_c` (XBB.2.3.13) and `20697_t` (HH.1) are identified as powerful identifiers.
*   **Broad Range:** The importance scores cover the full spectrum, from very high scores down to very subtle ones for lineages like `XBB.2.3.3` (`~1e-08` in the example).
*   **Lineage `HH.1`:** The top mutation, `20697_t`, has an importance of `0.54`. This mutation (T690I in the Spike protein, though the example later clarifies it as nsp15:T690I) is a known marker, and the model correctly identified it as a key feature. This is a great validation of the approach.

## Interpretation of Saliency Reports
[Interpretation of Saliency Reports will be added here]

## Overall Conclusions & Synthesis

1.  **The Model Works and is Interpretable:** The pipeline successfully trains a classifier that can distinguish between fine-grained SARS-CoV-2 lineages and, more importantly, provides a method (saliency analysis) to understand *how* it's doing it.
2.  **Saliency Reflects Evolutionary Distance:** The magnitude of the "importance" score can be seen as a proxy for how evolutionarily distinct a sublineage is from its relatives *within the training data*. Lineages with high scores have likely accumulated a set of unique mutations that make them easy to spot. Lineages with low scores are likely "fuzzier" and genetically closer to their neighbors.
3.  **Identification of Key Markers:** The `saliency_report_top10.csv` files generated are essentially a list of the most important genetic markers for each lineage, as determined by the model. This is a computationally derived list that can guide further biological investigation.

## Potential Next Steps
1.  **Biological Cross-Validation:** Take the top 3-5 mutations for the highest-importance lineages and check them against virology resources (like `outbreak.info`, CoV-lineages, or recent papers). Do they fall in functionally important genes like Spike (S), Orf1ab, or Nucleocapsid (N)? Does the literature confirm they are defining markers?
2.  **Analyze Misclassifications:** Use the confusion matrix to find the most common misclassifications. Then, run saliency analysis on a *misclassified* sample. This can tell you *why* the model got confused.
3.  **Try a Tree-Based Model:** For tabular data, models like XGBoost or LightGBM often perform exceptionally well. They also have built-in feature importance methods (like SHAP values) which would be fascinating to compare with the neural network's saliency results.

*   **Data Profile:** 16,367 samples, 12,277 mutations, and a **staggering 95 distinct lineages**. This is an expert-level classification challenge.
*   **Model Performance:**
    *   **Training:** The model's validation accuracy climbed steadily and settled around a very impressive \`~98.8%\` (based on the provided logs, actual final val_accuracy was 97.98%).
    *   **Final Evaluation:** \`Final Test Accuracy: 97.98%\`. For a 95-class problem, this is a phenomenal result.
*   **Classification Report (A Story of Extremes):**
    *   **The Incredible:** The model perfectly classifies dozens of lineages, even many with very low support (e.g., \`HG.3\` with 1 sample, \`GS.7.1\` with 1 sample). This shows the power of your feature set; these lineages must have truly unique mutations.
    *   **The Total Failures:** You can see where the model gave up entirely.
        *   \`GM.2\`, \`GJ.1\`, \`GE.1.2.1\`: All have \`0.00\` for precision and recall. This means the model **never once** predicted these classes, and the few true samples in the test set were misclassified as something else. The model had insufficient data (support of 1 or 2) to learn their patterns.
    *   **The Near Misses:** Lineages like \`XBB.2.3.4\` (recall 0.80, though report shows 1.00) and \`HH.1.1\` (recall 0.80) show where the model had some trouble, likely due to genetic similarity with other lineages. *(Note: Some discrepancies between summary and detailed report values, using detailed report values here).*
*   **Synthesis with Saliency:**
    This again provides a perfect explanation for the saliency map. The lineages with high importance scores (\`HH.1\`, \`XCQ\`, etc. from the general saliency discussion) correspond to those with perfect \`1.00\` F1-scores in this report. The lineages with near-zero importance scores correspond to the ones the model failed on, like \`GM.2\` and \`GJ.1\`. Your model has successfully learned the distinct patterns for the majority of the 95 classes and has also clearly shown us which lineages are too rare or too genetically ambiguous to classify with the available data.

## Onto the Next Step: Biological Analysis
Here’s a simple, effective workflow:

1.  **Pick Your Targets:** Choose lineages from your results that have **high saliency/importance scores** and **high F1-scores** in the classification report. A great example from your data is \`HH.1\` (from the XBB clade).
2.  **Extract Key Mutations:** For each target lineage, list the top 5 mutations identified by your saliency report.
3.  **Annotate the Mutations:** For each mutation, find out:
    *   **What gene is it in?** (e.g., S gene for Spike, N gene for Nucleocapsid)
    *   **Does it cause an amino acid change?** (e.g., \`20697_t\` from your HH.1 report is a \`T\` to \`A\` substitution at position 20697, which translates to a Threonine to Isoleucine change at position 690 in the nsp15 protein, T690I). (The NCBI Gene track for the 13 Jan 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus/GCF_009858895.2 genome assembly is constructed from the NCBI nuccore entry for NC_045512.2 (reference sequence): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2)
4.  **Literature Search:** Search for these specific mutations (e.g., "S:N501Y", "nsp15:T690I") in Google Scholar or PubMed.
5.  **Synthesize:** Write a paragraph for each target lineage in your manuscript. For example:
    *   "Our model identified lineage HH.1 with high confidence (F1-score: 0.97). Saliency analysis revealed that the most influential mutation for this classification was \`20697_t\` (nsp15:T690I), with an importance score of 0.54. This aligns with existing virological data, as this mutation is a known marker for the HH lineage family, potentially affecting viral replication..."

This step provides powerful external validation for your entire methodology. It shows that your model isn't just finding random statistical correlations; it's independently re-discovering biologically significant markers.

## On Model Size and Further Experiments
*   **The Model is Not Overfitting:** The XBB (95-class) results show the model's performance on validation data is excellent and tracks the training performance well. The loss doesn't diverge. This suggests your model architecture (Dense 128 -> 64) is not excessively large or complex for the task. It has enough capacity to learn, but not so much that it's just memorizing noise.
*   **The Bottleneck is Data, Not Model Size:** The classification report clearly shows that the model's few failures are on lineages with \`support: 1\` or \`support: 2\`. This is a classic problem—if the model has never (or rarely) seen an example of a class, it cannot learn to identify it. No amount of model tuning (making it bigger or smaller) can fix a fundamental lack of data for a specific class.

*   **The core goal of this project is:** "to develop an end-to-end pipeline that can accurately classify fine-grained SARS-CoV-2 lineages and, using saliency analysis, we can interpret the model's decisions to identify the key mutations that define these lineages, which correspond to known biological markers."
