# Accessing MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) Sequence Databases

Connecting to MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) sequence databases involves a few primary sources and methods. The most prominent databases are:

1.  **IMGT/HLA Database (IPD-IMGT/HLA):** The international ImMunoGeneTics information systemÂ® for Human Leukocyte Antigens. This is the gold standard for human MHC (HLA) sequences and nomenclature.
2.  **IPD-MHC Database:** For non-human MHC sequences from various species.
3.  **NCBI (GenBank/RefSeq):** A general nucleotide and protein sequence database that contains a vast amount of MHC sequences, though not as curated specifically for MHC as IMGT.
4.  **IEDB (Immune Epitope Database):** While primarily for epitopes, it contains MHC allele information and links to sequences, and offers tools for MHC binding prediction.

Below is a Python script demonstrating programmatic access, primarily using NCBI's Entrez API (via Biopython) for broad querying, and discussing how to obtain data from IMGT/IPD (which often involves downloading datasets).

## Python Script for Accessing MHC Data

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import ftplib
from Bio import Entrez, SeqIO
import requests # For IEDB or other REST APIs

Entrez.email = "your_email@example.com" # Replace with your actual email
API_KEY = None # Optional: Replace with your NCBI API key for higher request rates
if API_KEY:
    Entrez.api_key = API_KEY

## Explanation and How to Use the Script

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Install Python 3.
    *   Install necessary libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install biopython requests pandas
        ```

2.  **Configuration:**
    *   `Entrez.email`: **Crucial!** In the Python script, replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your real email address. NCBI requires this to contact you if there's an issue with your script.
    *   `API_KEY`: Optional. If you make many requests to NCBI, get an API key from your NCBI account settings for higher rate limits and assign it to the `API_KEY` variable in the script.

3.  **NCBI Interaction (`query_ncbi_mhc`, `fetch_sequences_from_ncbi`):**
    *   The `query_ncbi_mhc` function searches NCBI's nucleotide or protein databases.
        *   `gene_name`: Can be specific (e.g., `"HLA-A*02:01"`) or general (e.g., `"MHC class II beta chain"`).
        *   `organism`: Scientific name (e.g., `"Homo sapiens"`, `"Mus musculus"`).
        *   `database`: Accepts `"nucleotide"` or `"protein"`.
        *   `retmax`: Defines how many initial IDs to fetch (the search might find more).
    *   The `fetch_sequences_from_ncbi` function downloads sequences for the given IDs into a FASTA (or GenBank, etc.) file.

4.  **IMGT/IPD Interaction (`download_imgt_data`):**
    *   IMGT/HLA and IPD-MHC are best accessed by downloading their curated datasets via FTP.
    *   The `download_imgt_data` function provides a basic way to connect to their FTP server (hosted by EBI) and download files.
    *   **Important:**
        *   FTP paths (like `ftp_path`) and filenames can change! **Always verify the correct paths on the official IMGT/IPD websites** before running the download parts of the script.
        *   Official Download Websites:
            *   IMGT/HLA Downloads: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/download/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/download/)
            *   IPD-MHC Downloads: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/mhc/download/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/mhc/download/)
        *   The script examples for IMGT/IPD are commented out by default. You'll need to uncomment them and provide correct, up-to-date paths if you wish to use them.
    *   Commonly downloaded files are FASTA files containing all nucleotide (`*_nuc.fasta`) or protein (`*_prot.fasta`) sequences for a given locus or species.

5.  **IEDB Interaction (`query_iedb_mhc_allele_info`):**
    *   IEDB's strength is in immune epitope data and MHC binding prediction tools, not primarily raw MHC sequence hosting (though it links to them).
    *   The example function `query_iedb_mhc_allele_info` demonstrates how you *might* interact with an IEDB API endpoint. The example shown uses the MHC-I binding prediction tool.
    *   For actual MHC sequences, you'd typically get them from IMGT or NCBI and then use IEDB's tools for analysis (e.g., predicting which peptides bind to a specific MHC allele sequence you've obtained).
    *   IEDB API documentation can be found at [http://tools-cluster-interface.iedb.org/tools_api/latest/](http://tools-cluster-interface.iedb.org/tools_api/latest/) or the newer [https://www.iedb.org/tools_api_v2_swagger/](https://www.iedb.org/tools_api_v2_swagger/).

6.  **Basic Analysis (`analyze_sequences_from_file`):**
    *   This is a placeholder function demonstrating how to use `Bio.SeqIO` to parse a downloaded FASTA file, count sequences, and print basic information. This is where you would add more sophisticated analysis (alignments, motif finding, phylogenetic analysis, etc.).

7.  **Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**
    *   This block in the script shows example usage of the defined functions.
    *   NCBI examples are set to run by default if the script is executed directly.
    *   IMGT/IPD download examples are commented out â you'll need to uncomment them and update paths to use them.
    *   The IEDB example demonstrates calling one of its tool APIs.

## Further Analysis (Beyond this script)

Once you have the sequences (e.g., in a FASTA file from the script):

*   **Sequence Alignment:** Use Biopython's `Bio.Align` or external tools like ClustalW, MAFFT, MUSCLE.
*   **Phylogenetic Analysis:** Tools like PhyML, RAxML, IQ-TREE (often used after alignment).
*   **Motif Discovery:** MEME suite.
*   **Variant Calling:** If you have raw sequencing reads, align them to reference MHC sequences.
*   **MHC Typing:** Specialized tools for assigning HLA/MHC alleles from sequencing data (e.g., OptiType, HLA-LA, HISAT-genotype).
*   **Structural Analysis:** If you have protein sequences, predict structures (AlphaFold) or analyze existing PDB structures.

This script provides a solid foundation for accessing MHC sequence data programmatically. Remember to consult the documentation of each database for the most up-to-date access methods and data formats.
