# Ancestral Reconstruction Tutorial

Modern virology often involves analyzing datasets with thousands to millions of sequences, a scale that challenges traditional phylogenetic methods. This tutorial guides you through a powerful **hybrid strategy** for ancestral reconstruction. We will combine versatile Python libraries (`DendroPy`, `BioPython`) for data manipulation with high-performance command-line tools (`MAFFT`, `IQ-TREE`, `TreeTime`) for the most computationally intensive steps.

Ancestral State Reconstruction (ASR) is a technique used to infer the genetic sequences of ancestral organisms, providing critical insights into viral evolution, adaptation, and the emergence of new traits.

## Foundational Concepts and Tool Selection
Performing ASR at scale requires careful tool selection based on:
*   **Scalability:** Methods must efficiently handle large alignments and trees.
*   **Accuracy:** The reliability of inferred states is paramount.
*   **Flexibility:** The ability to script and integrate tools into a cohesive workflow is crucial.

### The Core Toolkit
A robust hybrid strategy relies on a combination of Python libraries and specialized command-line tools.

*   **Python Libraries for Phylogenetics:**
    *   **BioPython:** The cornerstone for bioinformatics in Python. Used for sequence I/O, format conversion, and accessing NCBI.
    *   **DendroPy:** A specialized Python library for sophisticated phylogenetic computing, including reading, writing, and manipulating trees and character matrices. Crucially, it has its own robust ASR functions.
    *   **ETE Toolkit:** A powerful library for programmatic tree manipulation, annotation, and visualization.

*   **Specialized Command-Line Tools:**
    *   **Sequence Clustering (for large datasets):** **MMseqs2** or **CD-HIT**.
    *   **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):** **MAFFT** or **FAMSA** are highly recommended for speed and efficiency on large datasets.
    *   **Phylogenetic Inference:** **IQ-TREE**, RAxML, or FastTree for building the tree.
    *   **Ancestral Reconstruction:** **TreeTime** for joint inference of ancestral sequences and time-scaled trees.

## The Challenge of Scale: Why a Direct Approach Fails
When scaling to datasets of millions of sequences, a direct ASR analysis becomes computationally impossible.

1.  **Memory (RAM) Overload:**
    *   **The Character Matrix:** An alignment of 8 million sequences by 1,000 characters would require **>8 GB** of RAM for the sequence data alone.
    *   **The Tree Object:** A tree with 8 million leaves has ~16 million nodes. The Python object representation in memory would be immense.
    *   **The ASR Results:** Storing the inferred ancestral states for every character at every node would require **over 100 GB of RAM**, exceeding the capacity of almost all systems.

2.  **Tree Inference:**
    *   Fundamentally, building a phylogenetic tree with 8 million leaves is a monumental challenge. Standard tools like RAxML or IQ-TREE cannot handle this scale.

> **The Solution:** You cannot analyze the 8-million-leaf tree in one go. Instead, you must adopt a strategy of **reduction or decomposition**. Python libraries like DendroPy are incredibly powerful for scripting these complex workflows.

## Strategies for Large-Scale ASR

### Strategy 1: Subsampling and Representative Analysis (Most Recommended)
This is the most common and scientifically sound approach, as most large datasets contain significant redundancy.

**The Workflow:**
1.  **Cluster Sequences:** Use a rapid tool like **MMseqs2** or **CD-HIT** to group sequences by a high identity threshold (e.g., 99%).
2.  **Select Representatives:** Pick one sequence from each cluster. This can drastically reduce a dataset of 8 million sequences to a manageable 5,000-50,000.
3.  **Build a Manageable Tree:** Build a phylogeny using only the representative sequences with a tool like IQ-TREE.
4.  **Perform ASR on the Representative Tree:** Use TreeTime or DendroPy to perform ASR on this smaller tree. The inferred ancestral states for a representative can be inferred to apply to the entire cluster it represents.

### Strategy 2: Divide and Conquer (Analyze by Clade)
If you must process information from all sequences, you can break the massive tree into smaller, independent subtrees (clades) and analyze them separately.

**The Workflow:**
1.  **Load the Massive Tree:** A major hurdle requiring enormous RAM or specialized out-of-core libraries.
2.  **Identify Major Clades:** Use a DendroPy script to traverse the tree and identify large, well-supported clades of a manageable size.
3.  **Extract Subtrees and Sub-alignments:** For each clade, use a script to extract the subtree and its corresponding sequences.
4.  **Analyze Each Subtree in Parallel:** Run your ASR script on each smaller subtree/alignment pair.
5.  **Synthesize Results:** The hardest part, as you will have results for many clades but not for the deep "backbone" of the tree connecting them.

<summary><b>Click for Conceptual DendroPy Script for "Divide and Conquer"</b></summary>

This script shows how you would automate the extraction of clades. **Note: This is a non-executable conceptual script**, as loading an 8-million-leaf tree into a `full_tree` object is generally not feasible.

```python
import dendropy

# --- ASSUME these objects have been loaded (the impossible step) ---
# full_tree = dendropy.Tree.get(...)
# full_matrix = dendropy.DnaCharacterMatrix.get(...)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Define the size range for a "manageable" clade
MIN_CLADE_SIZE = 1000
MAX_CLADE_SIZE = 10000

# Traverse the tree and find nodes that root clades of the right size
for node in full_tree.preorder_node_iter():
    num_tips = len(node.leaf_nodes())
    if MIN_CLADE_SIZE <= num_tips <= MAX_CLADE_SIZE:
        clade_taxa_labels = [leaf.taxon.label for leaf in node.leaf_nodes()]

        # 1. Create a new tree from this node (the subtree)
        subtree = dendropy.Tree(seed_node=node, taxon_namespace=full_tree.taxon_namespace)
        subtree.write(path=f"clade_{node.label}.nex", schema="nexus")

        # 2. Filter the full character matrix to get the sub-matrix
        sub_matrix = full_matrix.export_character_subset(taxon_labels=clade_taxa_labels)
        sub_matrix.write(path=f"clade_{node.label}_seqs.fasta", schema="fasta")

        # Now you can run ASR on the extracted files.
        # To avoid processing sub-clades within this major clade,
        # we can tell the iterator to skip descending into this node.
        node.edge.tail_node = None
```

## A Practical ASR Workflow

### Prerequisites
*   **Python:** Version 3.7+ with `biopython`, `dendropy`, `ete3`, and `phylotreetime`.
*   **Command-Line Tools:** `MAFFT`, `IQ-TREE`.
*   **Optional (for large datasets):** `MMseqs2` or `CD-HIT`.
*   **Input Data:** Your sequences (FASTA), and optionally a metadata file with sampling dates for TreeTime.

### Step 1: Data Preparation

<details>
<summary><b>1A: Acquire and Prepare Sequence Data</b></summary>

If your sequences are not in a file, you can fetch them from NCBI. For very large bulk downloads, using NCBI's command-line utilities is often more efficient than scripting with BioPython.

*   **Option 1: BioPython (for smaller, targeted retrievals)**
    ```python
    from Bio import Entrez, SeqIO
    Entrez.email = "your.email@example.com" # ALWAYS tell NCBI who you are
    accession_numbers = ["MN908947.3", "MT291826.1"]
    handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id=accession_numbers, rettype="fasta", retmode="text")
    with open("retrieved_sequences.fasta", "w") as f:
        f.write(handle.read())
    handle.close()
    ```
*   **Option 2: NCBI Command-Line Tools (for large bulk downloads)**
    *   **`ncbi-datasets-cli` (Modern & Recommended):**
        ```bash
        # Download genomes by accession list
        ncbi-datasets-cli download genome accession --inputfile accession_list.txt --filename genomes.zip
        ```
    *   **`Entrez Direct` (Classic & Powerful):**
        ```bash
        # Search for and download sequences matching a query
        esearch -db nucleotide -query '"SARS-CoV-2"[Organism] AND "complete genome"[Title]' \
          | efetch -format fasta > sars_cov_2_complete_genomes.fasta
        ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1B: Cluster and Subsample (for very large datasets)</b></summary>

Use a tool like **MMseqs2** to reduce dataset size by clustering similar sequences.
```bash
# Cluster sequences at 99% identity and get representative sequences
mmseqs easy-cluster retrieved_sequences.fasta cluster_results tmp --min-seq-id 0.99
# The output file will be cluster_results_rep_seq.fasta
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1C: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)</b></summary>

Align your (potentially subsampled) sequences. For large datasets, **MAFFT** is an excellent choice.
```bash
# MAFFT automatically chooses a fast strategy and uses multiple threads
mafft --auto --thread 16 your_sequences.fasta > aligned_sequences.fasta
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>1D: Phylogenetic Tree Inference</b></summary>

Infer a tree from your alignment using a tool like **IQ-TREE**.
```bash
# Infer a tree using the GTR+F+G4 model and auto-detect threads
iqtree -s aligned_sequences.fasta -m GTR+F+G4 -nt AUTO -pre my_tree
# The main tree file will be my_tree.treefile
```
</details>

### Step 2: Ancestral Reconstruction (ASR)
Choose the tool that best fits your needs. TreeTime is excellent for integrating time-scaling, while DendroPy offers deep programmatic control.

*   **A. Using TreeTime (Command-Line)**
    This is powerful when you have sampling dates and want a time-scaled tree.
    ```bash
    # Assumes you have a metadata file 'dates.csv'
    treetime ancestral --aln aligned_sequences.fasta \
                       --tree my_tree.treefile \
                       --dates dates.csv \
                       --outdir treetime_output
    ```
    **Key Outputs:** `annotated_tree.nexus` (view in FigTree), `ancestral_sequences.fasta`.

*   **B. Using DendroPy (Programmatic)**
    This gives you fine-grained control within a Python script.
    ```python
    import dendropy

    # Load alignment and tree, ensuring taxon namespaces match
    char_matrix = dendropy.DnaCharacterMatrix.get(path="aligned_sequences.fasta", schema="fasta")
    tree = dendropy.Tree.get(
        path="my_tree.treefile",
        schema="newick",
        taxon_namespace=char_matrix.taxon_namespace
    )

    # Perform Maximum Parsimony ASR (faster)
    print("Running Maximum Parsimony ASR...")
    tree.reconstruct_ancestral_states(character_matrix=char_matrix, method="parsimony")

    # For Maximum Likelihood ASR (more accurate but complex), you would specify a model:
    # from dendropy.model.discrete import Gtr
    # sub_model = Gtr() # Configure model parameters
    # tree.reconstruct_ancestral_states(char_matrix, method="likelihood", submodel=sub_model)
    
    print("ASR complete. Ancestral states are now annotated on the tree nodes.")
    ```

### Step 3: Visualizing and Interpreting Results
*   **Tree Visualization:** Use **FigTree** or **iTOL** to open the annotated tree file (e.g., `treetime_output/annotated_tree.nexus`). Display ancestral states or mutations on the nodes and branches to identify key evolutionary changes.
*   **Programmatic Analysis:** Use Python libraries like **ETE Toolkit** or **DendroPy** to parse the annotated tree, traverse it, and extract specific ancestral states for downstream analysis or custom plotting.

## A Critical Caveat: Understanding Uncertainty in ASR
> **Key Principle:** The deeper a node is in a phylogenetic tree, the more uncertain its reconstructed state will be.

This is not a minor detail; it's a fundamental limitation of ASR.

*   **Why is deep ASR so uncertain?**
    1.  **Signal Erosion (Mutational Saturation):** Over long evolutionary times, a single site can mutate multiple times (e.g., A→G→C→T). We only see the start (A) and end (T) states, losing the intermediate information. This makes it statistically difficult to be certain about the ancestral state.
    2.  **Propagated Error:** ASR is only as good as its inputs. Deep branches in a tree are the hardest to resolve correctly. If the tree topology or branch lengths are wrong at a deep level, the ASR for that ancestor will be built on a flawed foundation.

*   **What This Means for Our Strategy:**
    *   ASR on a **backbone tree** of representatives (Strategy 1) provides a valuable, but hypothetical, view of deep evolution. Treat these deep ancestors with skepticism.
    *   ASR on **shallow clades** (Strategy 2) is generally far more reliable, as the signal is stronger and the tree is more accurate over shorter time scales.

## Conclusion
This tutorial outlines a hybrid approach to ASR, leveraging Python libraries for flexibility and specialized command-line tools for performance. For large-scale viral datasets, strategies like subsampling or "divide and conquer" are essential. Whether using TreeTime for its integrated time-scaling or DendroPy for fine-grained programmatic control, the key is to choose tools appropriate for your research question and to critically assess the uncertainty inherent in any evolutionary inference.
