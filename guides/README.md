## ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Pipelines and Tutorials

This section contains step-by-step tutorials and end-to-end pipelines for specific analyses.

*   [**Ancestral Reconstruction Tutorial**](./ancestral_reconstruction_tutorial.md)
    *   *A tutorial on performing ancestral sequence reconstruction using tools like TreeTime and DendroPy.*
*   [**SARS-CoV-2 Transformer Modeling Pipeline**](../pipelines/sars_cov2_transformer_pipeline.md)
    *   *A tutorial on processing SARS-CoV-2 data for use in Transformer-based generative models.*
*   [**SARS-CoV-2 Lineage Classification Pipeline**](../pipelines/sars_cov2_lineage_classification/README.md)
    *   *Documentation for the end-to-end pipeline that classifies SARS-CoV-2 lineages with a neural network and interprets the results.*
*   [**Guided Pipeline #1: Ancestral Sequence-Based Viral Evolution Modeling**](./PIPELINE.md)
    *   *An end-to-end guided pipeline for training a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model on viral evolution data. It demonstrates data acquisition from UShER and NCBI, ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) with IQ-TREE, data preparation, model training with TensorFlow/Keras, and inference. The guide also discusses the computational and biological limitations encountered on standard cloud-based hardware and serves as a documented baseline for future research.

*   [**Guided Pipeline #2: Interpretable Viral Evolution Modeling**](./PIPELINE_2.md)
    *   *An end-to-end pipeline demonstrating how a Transformer model, trained on phylogenetically-derived ancestor-descendant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences, can autonomously learn to identify key functional regions (RBD and NTD) through its attention mechanism. This guide covers data acquisition, ancestral state reconstruction, model training, and attention-based interpretability.
