# Text and Data Files for PAML Tools

This directory contains text-based data files, mock outputs, and guides used by or in conjunction with the PAML tools scripts.

## File Descriptions

*   **`TESTING_GUIDE.md`**: Contains instructions and guidelines for testing the PAML utility scripts.
*   **`expected_script_output.txt`**: A sample file showing the expected output format or content from one of the PAML scripts, likely used for comparison during testing.
*   **`mock_yn00_output.txt`**: A mock (simulated) output file from the PAML `yn00` program. This is used by `calculate_dn_ds.py` in simulation mode to allow testing without requiring PAML to be installed.
*   **`sample_aligned.fasta`**: A sample FASTA file containing aligned coding sequences. This file is used as example input for scripts like `calculate_dn_ds.py` and `calculate_site_specific_ds_dn.py`.
