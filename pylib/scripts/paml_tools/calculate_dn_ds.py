"""
Calculates pairwise dN/dS (Ka/Ks) ratios for sequences from an aligned FASTA file.

This script utilizes BioPython to interface with PAML's `yn00` program to perform
the dN/dS calculations. The script then parses the output generated by `yn00`
to extract dN (non-synonymous substitution rate), dS (synonymous substitution
rate), and omega (dN/dS ratio) for each pair of sequences.

Usage:
  python calculate_dn_ds.py <path_to_aligned_fasta_file>

Arguments:
  fasta_file: Path to the input FASTA file. This file must contain two or more
              coding sequences that have already been aligned.

PAML Dependency:
  For actual dN/dS calculations (i.e., not simulating), this script requires
  PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) to be installed, and the
  `yn00` executable from PAML must be in the system's PATH. If `yn00` is not
  found, the script will output an error. PAML can be obtained from:
  http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html

  Note on PAML programs: This script uses `yn00` from PAML, which is designed
  for pairwise calculation of dN/dS rates. For more complex analyses, such as
  detecting positive selection at specific codon sites or using different
  evolutionary models, PAML's `codeml` program is a more comprehensive tool.
  This script focuses on the pairwise estimation provided by `yn00` via the
  BioPython wrapper.

Simulation Mode:
  The script can run in a simulation mode for development or testing purposes
  without requiring PAML. This is controlled by the `SIMULATE_PAML` environment
  variable:
  - If `SIMULATE_PAML` is set to `true` (default) or not set, the script will
    simulate a `yn00` run and generate dummy output.
  - If `SIMULATE_PAML` is set to `false`, the script will attempt to execute
    the actual `yn00` program.

Input File Format:
  - Aligned FASTA format.
  - Sequences should be coding sequences (CDS).
  - Must contain at least two sequences for pairwise comparison.

Output Format:
  - Tab-separated values printed to standard output:
    Seq1_ID\tSeq2_ID\tdN\tdS\tdN_dS_ratio
  - `dN_dS_ratio` is the 'omega' value from the `yn00` output.
